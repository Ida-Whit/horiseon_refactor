## Name
Project 1 (Horiseon Refactor)

## Description
This project was centered mainly on refactoring existing code for the Horiseon home webpage. The original code that was given to me was a bit messy and hard to read/follow. I went in and cleaned up the HTML elements by using semantic HTML. In this way, I was able to make this code a bit easier to read. There was also a lot of repetition within the style sheet in terms of non-needed classes. I went through and cleaned those up as well to make the style sheet a bit more succinct.
